        <h2>The Farm</h2>
        Double C Lowlines was founded in 2010 by brothers Jamie and Gino Castagna in Pike County Missouri.
        <br>
        Double Câ€™s mission is to provide high quality beef that comes from raising healthy cattle, free from hormones and antibiotics, on pasture.  We utilize intensive grazing including the use of annuals to maintain pasture quality and maximize production.   The cattle are born, raised, and finished on pasture; this natural low stress process produces animals that are healthy and calm.

        <h2>The Herd</h2>
        Double C lowlines has a herd based on genetics from Lowline/Aberdeen angus cattle.  <br> These breeds do exceptionally well in a pasture-based production system.  Lowline cattle are bred to be easy calfing, efficient, and require minimal inputs and labor.  We purchased the herd from several small farms back in 2010 and it has been a closed herd since then.  We have consistently improved our genetics through the purchase of high quality bulls and AI.
